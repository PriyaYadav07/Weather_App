# Weather App
<br>
Building a Weather app with JavaScript is a brilliant project for beginners. It helps students understand the core basics of the DOM and teaches how to use fetch API.<br>

This is a simple javascript project made with the help of HTML, CSS, and OpenWeather API. We used weather API to fetch data and display it according to the city entered in the search bar.
